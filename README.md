# TabTransformer
Implementation of TabTransformer: Tabular Data Modeling Using Contextual Embeddings

## Description
Despite the recent explosion of Deep Learning for image, audio, and text, it seems like tasks using good of structured tabular data have been somewhat ignored.
In this video we look into two different papers:

1. "TabNet: Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning;  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07442;
https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet
 

2. "TabTransformer: Tabular Data Modeling Using Contextual Embeddings" 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06678

We also apply the later one on Poker Hand Data Set to see its accuracy.
